<div style="text-align:justify">  
  During the course of this 5 days in-person summer school, we will study mathematical tools to solve the dynamic resource allocation problems in communication networks. Most of the resource allocation problems are known to be NP-hard to solve. However, it is possible to design efficient heuristics using the theory of Markov decision processes. We will talk about different heuristics, such as LP-based and Whittle index policies, and provide proof of their performances. To complete these first formal approaches, we will also take a different path to solve such problems by using Deep Reinforcement Learning algorithms. 

  All the techniques seen during this class will be illustrated on different network problems such as adaptive routing, TCP control, optimal control of the age of information, and optimal channel selection. This course will also have some lab sessions and we will provide code in python to implement the different algorithms seen during the class.
