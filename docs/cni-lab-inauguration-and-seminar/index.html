Over this period, the core WiFi standards have evolved through IEEE 802.11, 802.11b, 802.11a, 802.11g, 802.11n, 802.11ac 802.11ax (soon to be ratified, and also called WiFi6), and the emerging 802.11be. Until IEEE 802.11n, opportunities for WiFi nodes to transmit over the wireless medium, have been controlled by the Distributed Coordination Function (DCF), the IEEE 802.11 implementation of CSMA/CA. IEEE 802.11ax and beyond now include OFDMA, but opportunities for nodes to access the wireless medium are still governed by DCF; once an access point (AP) gets access, it can transmit to or receive from multiple nodes by utilising OFDMA and multi-user MIMO. Over the past two to three decades, the Internet has become the ubiquitous technology for packet networking, agnostic to the physical communication technologies interconnecting the endpoints. The predominant transport protocol (in terms of volume of data carried) is TCP, and file transfer (either via HTTP or FTP) is a major application that runs over TCP.</p><p>This will be a tutorial level presentation of stochastic modeling that aims to provide insights into the performance of TCP controlled file transfers over WiFi and DCF, with the eventual goal of building an understanding of file transfer performance in multi-AP networks. We will begin the presentation from the now classic fixed-point model for saturated nodes in a single AP setting, and then describe models for predicting TCP controlled file transfer throughputs. Network effects will be brought in by showing the effects of channel errors (induced by co-channel interference), and by some simple models of interfering co-channel multi-AP networks. While the models will be largely developed for now “legacy” networks up to IEEE 802.11n, models for 11ac and 11ax networks can be built as extensions of the models we present, and we will provide insights into how this could be done.</p><p><strong>Bio:</strong></p><p>Prof. Anurag Kumar, B.Tech (1977) IIT Kanpur, PhD (1981) Cornell Univ., was a Member of Technical Staff in AT&amp;T Bell Laboratories (1981-1988), before returning to India and joining the Indian Institute of Science (IISc) as a faculty member in the ECE Department.

He has published almost 200 peer reviewed papers in journals and conferences, in the area of communications networking and distributed systems.</p><p>Prof. Kumar returned to India at a time when the telecommunications revolution was just taking off and the Internet was just a fledgling network. He was one of the leaders of the ERNET project that established India’s first nationwide Internet, that carried academic traffic for over a decade. Prof. Kumar was one of the early researchers in India in the mathematical approach to understanding and designing modern communication networks. He has led the authorship of two major text books on communication networking that have been used around the world.</p><p>He was the 1977 President’s Gold Medalist in IIT Kanpur.

During the period 2005-2009, he was an area editor for the IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking and was then on its steering committee from 2010-2014. He received the 2015 Vasvik Award for Information Technology, and the 2017 IEI-IEEE Award for Engineering Excellence. He is a recipient of the J.C. Bose National Fellowship, awarded by the Department of Science and Technology, for the period 2011-2021.</p></div><div style="padding: 10px;border: 1px solid gray;margin: 0;box-shadow: 1px 1px 5px 1px;" markdown="1"><p><strong>Time:</strong> 18 Jan 2021, 03:00 pm – 03:55 pm</p><p><strong>Speaker:</strong> Prof. Abhay Karandikar</p><p><strong>Title:</strong> Connecting the Unconnected in 5G and Beyond</p><p><strong>Abstract:</strong></p><p>In this talk, we review the challenges in connecting the unconnected and argue on rethinking the requirements of 5G and beyond systems. We propose an architecture called “Frugal 5G” for affordable broadband access and IEEE P2061. We discuss the architectural elements of Frugal 5G and its implementation within 3GPP 5G framework. Specifically, we present an OpenFlow based RAN architecture which enables unified access control at the edge. Finally, we show how by using Software Defined Networking and Network function virtualization, we can realize the architecture for providing affordable connectivity.</p><p><strong>Bio:</strong></p><p>Prof. Abhay Karandikar is currently serving as the Director of IIT Kanpur.
