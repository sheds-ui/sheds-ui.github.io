He will begin by briefly describing his expectations for granting a doctorate degree. He will then talk about integrity in research, which will involve discussions on plagiarism, proper etiquette for citing others&#39; works, what constitutes a mistake versus a fraud, and how to best present one&#39;s results. Next, He will discuss some strategies for success. These strategies will include (i) a self-examination to assess your own readiness for embarking on a PhD; (ii) how to choose and interact with your advisor, (iii) some strategies for building your tool-set in order to prepare yourself before and during the research process; (iv) a discussion on how to choose a good problem; (v) strategies for solving difficult problems that He have observed to work well, and what to look for in a solution; (vi) how to write a good paper, mistakes to avoid, and some resources that you should always have in your personal library; and (vii) how to create an intellectual environment that will enable you to graduate into a scholar rather than only being a specialist technician. This talk is based on his own observations, mistakes, and interactions with a variety of PhD students and colleagues over the past thirty.”</p><br><h6 style="width: 20px; display: inline-block;">Bio</h6><h5><a href="https://cse.osu.edu/people/shroff.11">Prof. Ness B. Shroff, Ohio State University</a></h5><p>Ness B. Shroff received his Ph.D. degree from Columbia University, NY in 1994 and joined Purdue university immediately thereafter as an Assistant Professor. At Purdue, he became Professor of the school of Electrical and Computer Engineering and director of CWSA in 2004, a university-wide center on wireless systems and applications. In July 2007, he joined the ECE and CSE departments at The Ohio State University, where he holds the Ohio Eminent Scholar Chaired Professorship of Networking and Communications. From 2009-2012, he also served as a Guest Chaired professor of Wireless Communications at Tsinghua University, Beijing, China, and from 2012-2016 an Honorary Guest Professor at Shanghai Jiatong University. He currently holds a visiting position at the Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay. Dr. Shroff’s serves as the Principal Investigator and Institute Director of the NSF AI Institute on Future Edge Networks and Distributed Intelligence (ai-edge.osu.edu). His research focuses on fundamental problems in machine learning, network optimization, stochastic control, and algorithmic design. His work contributes to the design, control, performance, pricing, and security of complex systems such as communication networks, computing, storage and cloud based systems, social networks, and recommendation systems. He served as the Editor in Chief of the IEEE/ACM Trans. on Networking, and currently serves as the Steering Committee Chair of ACM Mobihoc. He has given several keynote addresses at major conferences and has also organized a number of workshops for the National Science Foundation. Dr. Shroff is a Fellow of the IEEE, and a National Science Foundation CAREER awardee. His papers have received numerous awards at top-tier venues. For example, he received the best paper award at IEEE INFOCOM 2006, IEEE INFOCOM 2008, and IEEE INFOCOM 2016, the best paper of the year in the journal of Communication and Networking (2005) and in Computer Networks (2003). He also also received runner-up awards at IEEE INFOCOM 2005 and IEEE INFOCOM 2013. In addition, his papers have received the best student paper award (from all papers whose first author is a student) at ACM Sigmetrics 2017, IEEE WiOPT 2013, IEEE WiOPT 2012, and IEEE IWQoS 2006. Dr. Shroff is on the list of highly cited researchers from Thomson Reuters ISI (previously ISI web of Science) in 2014 and 2015, and in Thomson Reuters Book on The World&#39;s Most Influential Scientific Minds in 2014. He received the IEEE INFOCOM achievement award for seminal contributions to scheduling and resource allocation in wireless networks, in 2014.</p></div><footer class="site-footer"><div class="footer-container"><a href="mailto:contact.cni@iisc.ac.in" title="Email" target="_blank"><i class="fa-solid fa-envelope"></i> </a><a href="https://github.com/cni-iisc" title="GitHub" target="_blank"><i class="fa-brands fa-github"></i> </a><a href="https://x.com/cni_iisc" title="X" target="_blank"><i class="fa-brands fa-x-twitter"></i> </a><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/cni-iisc" title="LinkedIn" target="_blank"><i class="fa-brands fa-linkedin"></i> </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/@centrefornetworkedintellig5324" title="YouTube" target="_blank"><i class="fa-brands fa-youtube"></i> </a><a href="https://www.instagram.com/cni_iisc/" title="Instagram" target="_blank"><i class="fa-brands fa-instagram"></i></a><p>&copy; 2025 Centre for Networked Intelligence.
