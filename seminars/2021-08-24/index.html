In this talk, I will provide a brief overview of my research activities related to enabling technologies for 5G and Beyond with a focus on artificial intelligence (AI)-Inspired Wireless Communications. To be specific, I will first discuss top challenges of incorporating AI in wireless communications and introduce the concept of the reservoir computing, a brain-inspired recurrent neural network-based computing methodology, to address some of the key challenges. As a critical task for receive processing, we investigate the application of reservoir computing in the classification task — symbol detection task for MIMO-OFDM systems. Unlike most existing neural network-based symbol detection strategies which require large training sets/overheads, our goal is to design reservoir computing-based symbol detector under limited training sets so that the size of the utilized training set is compatible with those adapted in modern wireless standards (e.g., 3GPP LTE/LTE-Advanced and Wi-Fi). Compared with the benchmark methods (linear minimum mean square error detector and sphere decoder), numerical evaluations suggest that reservoir computing-based MIMO-OFDM symbol detector can improve the symbol detection performance as well as effectively mitigate model mismatch effects using very limited training symbols. Furthermore, we developed a real-time online learning version of the reservoir computing-based MIMO-OFDM symbol detector and implemented the strategy on the software defined radio (SDR) platform for Wi-Fi systems. Keep the Wi-Fi transmitter untouched, the new plug-and-play reservoir computing-based Wi-Fi receiver is comp ared with traditional Wi-Fi receivers using over-the-air experiments. The performance suggests that the introduced symbol detector outperforms conventional Wi-Fi symbol detection methods in various environments indicating the significance and the relevance of the work.</p><br><h6 style="width: 20px; display: inline-block;">Bio</h6><h5>Lingjia Liu, Virginia Tech, USA</h5><p>Lingjia Liu is a Professor in the Bradley Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE) at Virginia Tech.
